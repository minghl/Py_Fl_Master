## 1. setting up for Frontend 

Because our front-end is built using the React framework, we need a JavaScript runtime environment called Node. 

Environmental preparation: 
Install Node.js and npm: This is the runtime environment for React projects, and you can download the installation package from the Node.js official website. ‌ 

```
https://nodejs.org/
```

Select the code editor: 

We recommend using Visual Studio Code, which provides rich extensions and powerful features. ‌

```
https://code.visualstudio.com
```

Get source code:

```
cd dir
git clone url
```

Download the library dependencies of node_modules: 

Because our code depends on other libraries, we need to install the environment in advance, so we need to perform the following operations. 

```
npm install
```

Enter the project directory and run the npm start command to start the local development server and view the React project, which is our PREDANO frontend page.

```
npm start
```

By following the above steps, users can successfully run our PREDANO React frontend project.
